## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Message` fields are empty should show "This field can't be empty"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Typescript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### Continued development

It is with great satisfaction that I express my gratitude for having completed this project. It was a very comprehensive and successful initiative, which involved the creation of a four-page website and represented an excellent test of my skills in building responsive layouts. The site in question is a complete marketing tool, which has personalized form validation. Importantly, I paid special attention to performance, accessibility, and SEO, which resulted in excellent reviews for Lighthouse (PC).

I have a strong desire to start larger projects, perhaps exploring different technologies.
